This work is currently for a school course project.
These are scripts of dataset distillation for jet tagging, and they don't seem to work very well.

The Quark/Gluon jets dataset will be automatically downloaded when running the scripts

The Top/QCD jets dataset needs to be manually downloaded with the following links. These datasets are generated by Rikab Gambhir

  Pythia: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/rksgxkrcuguly1084j62n/AHhdFnytMo_Lnkmia8o4ZhI?rlkey=mwadopunqwgf31uqfrqql7f5g&e=8
  
  Herwig: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/e2674ya9wcni673x8v4j4/AOAlTlwE3IiLZZMHjBo_R4c?rlkey=9tsehcyliu0q2li2ibbj2lc74&e=5&dl=0

All these datasets are in .npz files and can be loaded manually

If using the ttag_jet.py to load

  Put ttag_jet.py in virtual_environment/lib/python3.9/site-packages/energyflow/datasets/
  
  Place the Pythia Top/QCD jets at ~/.energyflow/datasets
  
  The Herwig Top/QCD jets shall be placed at some other folder in ~/.energyflow since the loading herwig dataset part of the ttag_jet.py does not work well, and remember to change the 'cache_dir' argument to that folder direction.
